# File Director
### Bringing a new era of modpack development!

## Introduction to File Director;
- [File Director](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/filedirector) is a fork & continuation of [ModDirector](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/moddirector).

- File Director aims to be a hassle-free tool for modpack creators, streamlining update processes for a more seamless experience. Allowing you to download files from the internet right into your modpack instance!

## What's different from Mod Director so-far?
- File Director can once again download mods from CurseForge.
- Bulk downloading several files at a time per configuration `bundle.json`, as opposed to having an `url.json` or `curse.json` for each & every mod or file.
- Extracting .zip whole files instead of downloading individual files.
- Force updating files.
- Renaming files on download.
- Remote modpack version number checking!

**[New functionalities are explained in the wiki!](https://github.com/TerraFirmaCraft-The-Final-Frontier/FileDirector/wiki)**

## Usage of File Director in modpacks;
- You don't need to request permission for usage of File Director in your modpacks/projects. Credit, where credit is due, would be appreciated though.
